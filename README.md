# ByzantineGPT

## Pitch

ByzantineGPT is what would happen if OpenAI's gpt model developed dissociative-identity disorder. It is a shell script that enables users to use bespoke 'modes' that I have prompt-engineered *(sophisticated way of saying 'I wrote')*.

## Requirements

This script leverages a python tool called sgpt in order to tap into OpenAI's gpt model.

You can install it by typing the following command on your unix-based or unix operating system. 

```
pip3 install shell-gpt

```
## Initialisation

1. Following this, you'll need to get an API-key from OpenAI.
2. Then, run the command:
```
sgpt "Your-open-ai-key"

```
3. If this does not work, export your key to the following variable

```
export OPENAI_API_KEY="Your-api-key"
```

Have fun you sick freaks.
