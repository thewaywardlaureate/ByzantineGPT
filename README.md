# ByzantineGPT

ByzantineGPT is what would happen if OpenAI's gpt model developed dissociative-identity disorder. It is a shell script that enables users to use bespoke 'modes' that I have prompt-engineered *(sophisticated way of saying 'I wrote')*.

This script leverages a python tool called sgpt in order to tap into OpenAI's gpt model.

You can install it by typing the following command on Termux/your unix or unix based operating system.

```
pip3 install shell-gpt

```

Have fun you sick freaks.
